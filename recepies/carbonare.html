<p><h3>How to make it:</h4></p>

    <ol>
        <li><p>
            <strong>Prepare the Pasta:</strong> Fill a large pot with enough water to cover the pasta and bring it to a boil over high heat.</p> 
            <p>Once the water is boiling, add a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt. </p>
            <p>Add the pasta (400-500g) and cook for 7-8 minutes, or until al dente. </p>
            <p>If you prefer your pasta a bit softer, cook it for a few extra minutes. </p></li><p>


            
        </p><li><p><strong>Prep the Ingredients:</strong> While the pasta is cooking, slice the pancetta into bite-sized pieces. </p>

            <p>Mince the garlic, wash the parsley, and chop it into small pieces.</p></li>

            <li><p>
                <strong>Make the Sauce:</strong> In a separate bowl, grate the cheese. Add the two eggs and mix them with the grated cheese. </p>
                <p>Season with a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper, then stir everything well.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Fry the Pancetta:</strong> In a skillet, saut√© the pancetta over medium heat without adding extra oil. Let it crisp up until golden brown. </p>
                   <p> Turn off the heat, then add the minced garlic and chopped parsley. Stir everything together.</p></li>

                   <li><p><strong>Combine Pasta & Sauce:</strong> Once the pasta is cooked, drain it (but save a little pasta water). </p>
                    <p>Pour the pasta into the skillet with the pancetta mixture. </p>
                   <p> Then, immediately pour over the egg and cheese sauce, tossing everything together.</p> 
                    <p>If needed, add a bit of the reserved pasta water to achieve a creamier consistency.</p></li><p>
